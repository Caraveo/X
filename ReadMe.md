**EXTENSIBLE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE**

*XPL or X++ is a programming language that is designed to be easy to use and easy to learn. It is a compiled language that is designed to be compiled into C++ code. It is designed to be a general-purpose language that can be used for anything yet is leveraging the power of C++ to make it easier to make API calls and create simple programs with NICE interfaces.*

Our goal is to create a truly unique Cross(X) platform language that can be used to create anything from a simple task manager to a full-blown game engine.

It is a high-level scripting language, that is attempting to be a true programming language.
Not optimized for compilation speed yet for ease of use and readability.  It is considered a Mark-up Language with advanced features that allow it to be leveraged as a programming language.

Although we are not focusing on speed, we are focusing on the ability to create *fast* programs that can be used on any platform.  In the future, we plan on implementing a JIT compiler to make it even faster, as well as Garbage Collection, and a Memory Management System.

        DISPLAY[Greeting]
    ]

    #Display "Hello!"
    #Display "Hey"
    #Display "Hi"


***Don't SCREAM at my compiler! I mean it depends on what you're doing... Just a little joke. ðŸ˜’***
