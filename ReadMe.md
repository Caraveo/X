**EXTENSIBLE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE**

*XPL or X++ is a programming language that is designed to be easy to use and easy to learn. It is a compiled language that is designed to be compiled into C++ code. It is designed to be a general purpose language that can be used for anything yet is levaraging the power of C++ to make it easier to make API calls and create simple programs with NICE interfaces.*

Our Goal is to create a trully unique Cross(X) platform language that can be used to create anything from a simple task manager to a full blown game engine.

It is a high-level scripting language, that is attempting to be a true programming language.
Not optimized for compilation speed yet for ease of use and readability.  It is considered a Mark-up Language with adnaced features that allow it to be used as a programming language.

Although we are not focusing on speed, we are focusing on the ability to create *fast* programs that can be used on any platform.  In the future we plan on implementing a JIT compiler to make it even faster, as well as Garbage Collection, and a Memory Management System.

**FEATURES Inspired By Great Programming Languages**

    COMPILED - Fast Binaries and Fast Execution [C++]

    EXTENSIBLE - Meaning you can add your own features to the language [C++ Libraries]

    EASY TO USE - Easy and Fun to learn, Readable and Understandable [Python, C#]

    CROSS PLATFORM - Leveraged on any Platform [JavaScript]

    OBJECT ORIENTED - Object Oriented Programming [Objective C]

    FUNCTIONAL - Functional Programming Features 

    LINE - Line by Line Execution [Python]

    STRICT - Strict Syntax

    CHAINED - Chained Syntax [Swift]

    MODEL - Model Based Programming [Swift]


**Define a Class/Method/Function**

    X FUN[
        DISPLAY["Hello World"]
    ]

**Define a Variable <TYPE>**

    STRING String: Hello World! + 'Hello'

    INDEX: ARRAY/LIST/DICTIONARY
    JSON Object-like based Indexing System
